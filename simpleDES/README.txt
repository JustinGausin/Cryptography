# SimpleDES.py

SimpleDES.py is a Python file for a simple imitation of the true DES encryption algorithm.
SimpleDES encrypts a single 12 bit block into 4 rounds of encryption. 

## Usage

SimpleDES.py was written in Python 3.x so it requires Python3 to be executed. If python3 is not available, Repl.it offers a free online Python 3 interpreter. The code has been tested the local machine and Repl.it prior to the submission for accuracy.
 


## Other Notice

The file has quite a few print() functions to show the steps of operations. There is also 
a static 12 bit Plaintext and a static 9 bit Key. It is possible to removed these and apply the dynamic input and key (asked from the user). The dynamic code is already in the file but is commented out so it does not execute. A user can change this to examine how different plaintext and/or keys create different ciphertexts through SimpleDES.
 

##Issues
If there is any issues with the code, let me know.
