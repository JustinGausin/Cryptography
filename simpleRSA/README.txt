##RSANaive.py
RSANaive is a python implementation of RSA given the parameter of n,e,q,m.

#Usage
The program runs on Python 3. 

#Special_Notice
The program is a bit excessive to demonstrate the RSA algorithm for this homework. A few function of 
encryption and decryption would have suffice but I wanted to develop a real world scenario.
